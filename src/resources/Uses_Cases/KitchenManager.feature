Feature: Special Cook Project Management System
  As a customer, chef, or kitchen manager
  I want an efficient system to handle meal planning, ingredient sourcing, scheduling, and customer preferences
  So that cooking projects can be managed seamlessly

  Scenario: Customer stores dietary preferences and allergies
    Given a new customer "John Doe" creates a profile
    When he enters:
      | Preference Type | Value          |
      | Diet            | Pescatarian    |
      | Allergies       | Shellfish      |
    And saves the profile
    Then the system shows a confirmation: "Profile saved for John Doe (Pescatarian, Shellfish-Free)"
    And future meal recommendations exclude:
      | Beef           |
      | Shellfish      |

  Scenario: Chef views customer dietary restrictions
    Given customer "Maria Garcia" has these restrictions:
      | Dietary Need | Details          |
      | Allergy      | Peanuts          |
      | Preference   | Halal            |
    When chef "Ahmed Khan" opens "Maria"'s profile
    Then the system displays:
      """
      DIETARY FLAGS:
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Peanuts Allergy
      ‚úîÔ∏è Halal Certified
      """
    And any recipe containing "peanuts" is marked "Unsafe"

  Scenario: Customer reorders from past meals
    Given customer "Li Wei" has order history:
      | Date       | Meal               | Price |
      | 2023-11-10 | Mapo Tofu          | $14   |
      | 2023-11-12 | Vegetable Dumplings| $18   |
    When he selects "Re-order" for "Mapo Tofu"
    Then the system pre-fills his cart with:
      | Item        | Customization       |
      | Mapo Tofu   | Spiciness: Medium   |
    And shows: "Last ordered Nov 10 - Ready in 45 mins"

  Scenario: System blocks invalid ingredient combinations
    Given customer "Emma Clark" is "Gluten-Free"
    When she tries to order "Classic Wheat Pizza"
    Then the system shows:
      """
      ‚ùå Cannot Order:
      - Contains gluten (wheat flour)
      Suggested Alternatives:
      1. Cauliflower Crust Pizza (+$3)
      2. Gluten-Free Flour Pizza
      """
    And prevents checkout until resolved

  Scenario: AI recommends recipes based on user constraints
    Given the following user constraints exist:
      | Parameter       | Value               |
      | Maximum time    | 30 minutes          |
      | Available items | Eggs, Spinach, Bread|
      | Diet type       | Vegetarian          |
    When the user requests recipe recommendations
    Then the system should suggest matching recipes:
      """
      Recommended Recipes:

      1. Spinach Omelette
         - Preparation time: 25 minutes
         - Ingredients used: Eggs, Spinach
         - Nutrition: 280 kcal, 22g protein
         - Tags: High-protein, Vegetarian

      2. Garlic Spinach Toast

         - Ingredients used: Bread, Spinach
         - Nutrition: 180 kcal, 8g protein
         - Tags: Quick, Vegetarian
      """


  Scenario: Kitchen manager handles low inventory
    Given current stock levels:
      | Ingredient       | Quantity | Threshold |
      | Organic Tomatoes | 4 lbs    | 10 lbs    |
      | Basil            | 0.5 lbs  | 2 lbs     |
    When the inventory report runs
    Then the kitchen manager sees:
      """
      üî¥ CRITICAL:
      - Basil: 0.5 lbs (order 5 lbs)
      üü° WARNING:
      - Organic Tomatoes: 4 lbs (order 6 lbs)
      """
    And the "Order Now" button is enabled
